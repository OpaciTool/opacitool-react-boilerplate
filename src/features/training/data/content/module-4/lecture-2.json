Twenty-four readings at fifteen-second intervals equals six-minutes of observations.\n\nWhen opacity observations are complete, the highest six-minute average can be calculated. The best way to find the highest average is to use the “rolling average” method as shown in the following example."

OpaciTool can perform the calculation automatically.",
