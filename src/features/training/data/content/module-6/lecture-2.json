Instead of a six-minute average, EPA Method 203a allows for an averaging time between two and six minutes. The exact averaging time is set by the regulation affecting the source. EPA Method 203a is useful for intermittent sources with emission times of less than six minutes.",

This method is useful for sources which have high 'blips' of opacity due to characteristics of the process or control device.\n\nExample\n\nAssume a source has an opacity limit of 10% with an exception period of two minutes during fifteen minutes of observations. After observing the source for fifteen minutes, the number of opacity readings which exceed 10% are counted and it is determined that there were seven occurrences.\n\nSeven is then divided by four (because there are four readings in a minute) to determine the time period which exceeded 10%. The source exceeded 10% for 1.75 minutes which is compliant with the 2-minute limit.",
