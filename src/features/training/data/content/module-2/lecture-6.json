        "text": "The best way to control air emissions is to prevent them. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 tasked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to reduce pollution by modifying production processes, promoting the use of non-toxic or less toxic substances and implementing conservation techniques. The program, known as the Pollution Prevention (P2) Program, reduces millions of pounds of pollution every year.\n\nWhen air emissions can't be prevented, they must be controlled. Control devices attempt to reduce air emissions in one of the following ways:",
