        "text": "There are two types of visible emissions; point source and fugitive. Point source emissions come from smokestacks, chimneys, vents and pipes. Any exhaust device which concentrates emissions is a point source.\n\nFugitive emissions are those that do not pass through a point source. Sources of fugitive emissions include unpaved roads, storage piles, material handling and material transfer.  Fugitive emissions are not concentrated into a single exhaust point such as a stack or vent.\n\nFugitive emissions are those that do not pass through a point source. Sources of fugitive emissions include unpaved roads, storage piles, material handling and material transfer.  Fugitive emissions are not concentrated into a single exhaust point such as a stack or vent.\n\nSee if you can determine which emissions are point source and which are fugitive.
