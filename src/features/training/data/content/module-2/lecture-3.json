        "text": "Visible emissions consist of particles ranging from 0.1 µm (micrometer) to 200 µm. A micrometer is one-millionth of a meter. For reference, the average diameter of a human hair is 60 µm.\n\nIn the world of visible emissions and air pollution, you will often encounter terms such as PM, PM2.5 and PM10. PM stands for particulate matter and the number after references the size of the particulate matter. PM10 is particulate matter that is less than 10 µm in diameter or width. PM2.5 is particulate matter less than 2.5 µm.",
