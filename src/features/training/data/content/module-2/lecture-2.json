        "text": "When documenting opacity observations, it's important to record the shape of the plume being observed. There are five possible plume shapes, which are typically influenced by the presence and position of an atmospheric inversion layer. Normally, air temperature decreases with increasing altitude. However, in an inversion layer, the temperature increases as altitude rises."
