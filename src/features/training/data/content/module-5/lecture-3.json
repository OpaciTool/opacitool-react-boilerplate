These sources are considered to have intermittent emissions.\n\nIf a source has intermittent emissions or a continuous emission period of less than 6 minutes, an alternative test method may be needed. Alternative test methods (described later in the course), allow for lower averaging times and decreased time intervals between observations. The sourceâ€™s permit will usually state if an alternative test method should be used.",
