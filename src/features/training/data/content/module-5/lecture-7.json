        "text": "If the observer is required to perform opacity observations at night, they must be certified to conduct night observations. Night certification involves using artificial light to illuminate smoke from a smoke generator. This is a somewhat controversial topic within the smoke school industry. EPA Method 9 does not address night observations or specify requirements for light sources. Very few places offer night certification, and some states do not recognize this certification.",
